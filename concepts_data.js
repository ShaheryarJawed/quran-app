        "details": "\n<h3>The Essence of Monotheism</h3>\n<p>Tawheed is the most fundamental concept in Islam. It is the belief that Allah is One, unique, and without partner, equal, or rival. It is the core message of every Prophet sent to humanity, from Adam (AS) to Muhammad (ﷺ).</p>\n\n<h3>The Three Categories of Tawheed</h3>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        <strong>Tawheed ar-Rububiyyah (Lordship):</strong>\n        Belief that Allah alone is the Creator, Sustainer, and Owner of the universe. He gives life and causes death, and He controls all affairs. Even the polytheists of Makkah accepted this, but it was not enough to make them Muslims.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <strong>Tawheed al-Uluhiyyah (Worship):</strong>\n        This is the unifying call of the Prophets. It means directing <em>all</em> acts of worship—prayer, fear, hope, sacrifice, reliance—to Allah alone. To direct any act of worship to other than Allah is Shirk (polytheism), the only unforgivable sin if one dies upon it.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <strong>Tawheed al-Asma wa-Sifat (Names and Attributes):</strong>\n        Belief in all the Names and Attributes Allah has affirmed for Himself in the Quran and Sunnah, without denying them, altering their meaning, or explaining \"how\" they are (asking \"kayf\"). We affirm He hears and sees, but \"There is nothing like unto Him\" (42:11).\n    </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Significance in Daily Life</h3>\n<p>Living by Tawheed liberates the human soul. When you fear only Allah, you fear no worldly power. When you hope only in Allah, you are never disappointed by people. It provides a singular focus in life: the pleasure of the Creator, rather than the approval of the creation.</p>\n"

        "details": "\n<h3>The Foundation of Deen</h3>\n<p>The Prophet (ﷺ) described Islam as a structure built upon five pillars. If the pillars are weak, the building collapses. These actions integrate faith into daily life.</p>\n\n<h3>1. Shahada (The Testimony)</h3>\n<p>Declaring <em>\"La ilaha illallah, Muhammadur Rasulullah\"</em>. It is the entry point into Islam. It requires knowledge, certainty, acceptance, and submission. It is not just a password, but a promise.</p>\n\n<h3>2. Salah (Prayer)</h3>\n<p>The daily connection (Silah) between the slave and the Master. Performed five times a day, it acts as a spiritual cleanser. The Prophet (ﷺ) called it the comfort of his eyes.</p>\n\n<h3>3. Zakat (Charity)</h3>\n<p>A mandatory purification of wealth (2.5% of savings). It creates a circulation of wealth in society, purging the giver of greed and the receiver of envy.</p>\n\n<h3>4. Sawm (Fasting)</h3>\n<p>Abstaining from food, drink, and desires from dawn to sunset during Ramadan. It teaches Taqwa (God-consciousness), self-discipline, and empathy for the hungry.</p>\n\n<h3>5. Hajj (Pilgrimage)</h3>\n<p>A once-in-a-lifetime journey to the House of Allah in Makkah for those capable. It is a universal gathering demonstrating the equality of humanity before God.</p>\n"

It means understanding that nothing happens in the universe without Allah's knowledge, permission, and decree.</p>\n\n<h3>The Four Levels of Qadr</h3>\n<ol>\n    <li><strong>Al-Ilm (Knowledge):</strong> Allah knows what happened, what will happen, and what would have happened if things were different.</li>\n    <li><strong>Al-Kitabah (Writing):</strong> Allah wrote everything in the Preserved Tablet (Al-Lawh Al-Mahfuz) 50,000 years before creating the heavens and earth.</li>\n    <li><strong>Al-Mashiyyah (Will):</strong> Nothing occurs unless Allah wills it.</li>\n    <li><strong>Al-Khalq (Creation):</strong> Allah is the Creator of everything, including our actions.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>Peace of Heart</h3>\n<p>Qadr eliminates anxiety over the future and grief over the past.

They do not just give charity; they give the best of what they love. They treat others with mercy not because they expect a reward from people, but because they seek the Countenance of Allah.</p>\n\n<p>Allah says, \"Is the reward for Ihsan anything but Ihsan?\" (55:60).</p>\n"
