        title: "Actions are by Intentions",
        arabic: "إِنَّمَا الْأَعْمَالُ بِالنِّيَّاتِ، وَإِنَّمَا لِكُلِّ امْرِئٍ مَا نَوَى، فَمَنْ كَانَتْ هِجْرَتُهُ إِلَى اللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ فَهِجْرَتُهُ إِلَى اللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ، وَمَنْ كَانَتْ هِجْرَتُهُ لِدُنْيَا يُصِيبُهَا أَوْ امْرَأَةٍ يَنْكِحُهَا فَهِجْرَتُهُ إِلَى مَا هَاجَرَ إِلَيْهِ",
        english: "Actions are strictly judged according to intentions, and for every person is what he intended. So whoever emigrated for the sake of Allah and His Messenger, his emigration is to Allah and His Messenger. And whoever emigrated for the sake of a worldly gain or a woman to marry, his emigration is to what he emigrated for.",
        narrator: "Umar bin Al-Khattab (RA)",
        source: "Bukhari & Muslim",
        commentary: "This hadith constitutes one third of knowledge. It sets the framework for all deeds in Islam. Without a sincere intention (Ikhlas) for Allah alone, no deed is accepted, no matter how great it appears. Scholars often begin their books with this Hadith to remind themselves and readers of sincerity."

        commentary: "These five are the structural pillars of a Muslim's faith. Like a building cannot stand without columns, one's Islam is incomplete without these five fundamental practices."
